# Soft_Voting_Management_System


It is a C++ Project used STL and File Handling for Database. In this project i have made three panel 1st is Admin Panel where Admin will decide how many candidate appear for this election. 2nd is Voting Panel where voter can give their vote to candidate. And in this panel we checked if voter have a valid id and Age greater then= 18 then they can give their vote otherwise they can not. Here id means candidate Registration number i already store every candidate Registration number in my data base by which no one voter give any wrong vote for any candidate. And 3rd Panel is Result Panel. In this Panel i calculate the total number of vote to every Candidate. who will have Maximum vote they will be winner if two candidate will have equal number of vote then i checked age which candidate age is greater then they will be winner and if only one candidate is apply for election then there is no voting they will win
